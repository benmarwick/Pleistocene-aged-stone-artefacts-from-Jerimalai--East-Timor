### Contents:

This repository contains the code and data for our analysis of the stone artefacts from Sue O'Connor's excavations at Jeremalai, East Timor.

In the /code directory:

One Rmarkdown file that can be executed in R. This files contains sections of the narrative found in the published paper and R code used to analyse the data, compute statistics, and generate the data visualisations and tables. To execute these files, ensure all the files are together in a directory in the same structure as they are in this repository, then open R and run `knitr::knit2html("XXX")` where XXX is the name of the Rmd, including the .Rmd suffix and the quotation marks. There are many dependencies on non-core R packages and other software, see the dependencies section below for more details.

Nine R files containing code that the Rmarkdown file uses to load libraries, prepare radiocarbon dates for OxCal calibration, compute statistics, and manage dependencies. These files are sourced by the Rmarkdown file and are needed to execute the Rmarkdown file. The code is externalised in these R files purely as a convenience to improve the readability of the Rmarkdown file.

One html file that contains the output produced by the code in the Rmarkdown file. These are what you should get if the Rmarkdown file executes properly.

In the /data directory:

Twelve csv files of data. Three of these are raw data on age determinations, spit depths and sediment volumes. The rest are data on the stone artefact assemblage.

In the /figures directory

Sixteen png files that are the figures generated by the code in the Rmarkdown file. All the data visualisations in the manuscript are included here, plus a few other exploratory visualisations.

### Dependencies:

I used [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/) (version 0.98.953) on Windows 7 and Ubuntu 14.04 and these packages:

All of these are included in this repository using [packrat](http://rstudio.github.io/packrat/), a dependency management system that takes a snapshot of the libraries needed for this project and saves it in the project directory so that you can recreate those exact same libraries on another machine. To use this system, open the Rproj file in RStudio, then open the Rmd file and knit that.

Other system dependencies identified using `dependencies::needs()` (<https://github.com/ropensci/dependencies>):

-   pandoc (\>= 1.12.3) <http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc>
-   jags (\>= 3.0.0) <http://mcmc-jags.sourceforge.net/>
-   libcurl (version 7.14.0 or higher) <http://curl.haxx.se>

Note that these are external to R and are not bundled with this repository. You'll need to ensure they're installed yourself before executing the Rmarkdown file. Pandoc is installed when RStudio is installed.
