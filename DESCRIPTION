Description: Provides functions for two types of Bayesian methods, a one-way ANOVA for comparing groups of metric data 
    (such as artefact measurements over different phases of occupation, where an ANOVA is the common 
    null-hypothesis-significance-test, or NHST), and a Poisson exponential ANOVA for contingency 
    table analysis (such as artefact counts, where a chi-square is the common NHST). For detailed 
    discussion of methods, the motivation for using a Bayesian approach, see the supplementary material 
    at http://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.985406. This package Uses code from John K. Kruschke's book
    "Doing Bayesian Data Analysis: A Tutorial with R and BUGS""
